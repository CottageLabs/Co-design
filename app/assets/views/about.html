				<h1>About Co-design</h1>
				<p>
					Jisc, RLUK, RUGIT, SCONUL and UCISA are collaborating on a pilot of a new approach to innovation. This pilot is called the co-design programme and will run for the whole of 2013. If this pilot is a success the co-design programme will be widened to include more organisations.

            	<h1>Why</h1>
        	</div>
            <div class="text-paragraph">
            	Co-design is not a new concept to Jisc, much of our work is carried out through co-working with a range of individuals, colleges and universities. What’s new for this programme though, is that the co-design approach runs throughout the whole thing – from initial generation of ideas, through idea selection, and into the development of products, services and other outputs. Together we will be closely scrutinising all projects and we’ll be able to make decisions to change their focus, speed them up or stop them completely. This will mean we’ll have outputs that are more refined and tested, and most importantly that better meet the requirements of the people who will use them – the users and consumers in universities and colleges.
